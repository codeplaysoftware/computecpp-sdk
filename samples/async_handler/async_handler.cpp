/*  Async Handler Example
 *
 *  This sample code illustrates how to use an async handler.
 *
 *  Command groups with invalid local range are issued to queues
 *  and/or context that have an asynchronous handler associated with it.
 *
 *  The expected outcome of the sample code is to trigger the
 *  asynchronous handler a number of times. */

  /* An async handler functor can be used to handle SYCL asynchronous
   * errors (i.e., errors that happen while the command group is
   * executing on the device and cannot trigger a normal exception).
   * The async_handler is called when the cl::sycl::queue::wait_and_throw()
   * method is invoked. Note that exceptions are ignored if no wait and
   * throw is issued.
   *
   * This async handler takes the list of asynchronous exceptions
   * that have been captured by the runtime while executing the kernels.
   * a cl::sycl::exception_list object is a collection of std::exception_ptrs.
   * std::exception_ptrs can only be rethrown, at which point the exception
   * can be caught as usual and handled through the regular try/catch pair.
   *
   * In this example we re-throw the first exception and capture it to
   * set a boolean variable. It would be possible to catch every single
   * exception individually from the list by reordering the code such that
   * the for loop encapsulates the try/catch. */
