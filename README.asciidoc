Introduction
------------

image:https://travis-ci.org/codeplaysoftware/computecpp-sdk.svg?branch=master[Travis Badge]

This is the README for the ComputeCpp SDK, a collection of sample code,
utilities and documentation for Codeplay's ComputeCpp, an implementation
of the SYCL programming standard. You can find more information at:

 * http://computecpp.codeplay.com/
 * http://sycl.tech/

Contents
--------

* LICENSE.txt
    - The license this package is available under: Apache 2.0
* README.adoc
    - This readme file
* cmake/
    - Contains useful files for integrating ComputeCpp with existing
      projects. See later in this document for a description of the CMake
      modules provided.
* documentation/
    - Documentation for the SDK (including CMake and samples) written in
      ASCIIDoc.
* samples/
    - A collection of sample SYCL code, tested on ComputeCpp, provided as
      a learning resource and starting point for new SYCL software. CMake
      files are also provided for most samples.
* tools/
    - Useful tools for working with SYCL code and ComputeCpp. Includes a
      simple driver script for compiling SYCL code with ComputeCpp, an
      example Makefile and other utilities.
* util/
    - Example utility code that we expect will be useful for other projects
      as either a starting point or helper to achieve common tasks.

Setup
-----

CMake files are provided as a build system for this software. CMake version
3.2.2 is required at minimum, though later versions of CMake should continue
to be compatible.

The CMakeLists.txt file is located in the samples/ directory.

At minimum, one CMake variable is required to get the sample code
building - COMPUTECPP_PACKAGE_ROOT_DIR. This variable should be the root
directory of the ComputeCpp install (i.e. the directory with the the folders
bin, include, lib and so on).

You can additionally specify CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE and CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to
choose a Debug or Release build and the location you'd like to be used when
the "install" target is built.

In the documents directory there is a
link:documents/ComputeCpp_GettingStarted.asciidoc[getting started guide]
that serves as an introduction to SYCL and ComputeCpp. Additionally, there
is an link:documents/ComputeCpp_Integration_Guide.asciidoc[Integration
guide] should you wish to add ComputeCpp to existing projects.



Requirements
------------

* The samples should work with any SYCL 1.2 implementation, though have
  only been tested with ComputeCpp CE Public Beta v0.2.1

* OpenCL 1.2-capable hardware and drivers with SPIR 1.2 support

* pass:[C++11-compliant compiler and libstdc++ on GNU/Linux (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.6+)]

* CMake 3.2.2 and newer

Troubleshooting
---------------

The sample code should compile without error on our supported platforms.
If you run into trouble, or think you have found a bug, we have a JIRA
Service Desk available through the https://computecpp.codeplay.com/[ComputeCpp
website].

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

We have a link:documents/ComputeCpp_FAQ.asciidoc[FAQ document] available online.
