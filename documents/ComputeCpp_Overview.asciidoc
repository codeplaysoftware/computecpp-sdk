==  ComputeCpp(TM) Community Edition (CE): Beta Release

ComputeCpp Community Edition (CE) is a heterogeneous parallel programming
platform that provides a beta pre-conformant implementantion of SYCL(TM) 1.2
Khronos link:{syclSpecUrl}[specification].

ComputeCpp CE {version} beta release includes the ComputeCpp CE Package version
{version} and ComputeCpp CE SDK version {version}. The supported OpenCL 1.2
platforms for ComputeCpp CE beta release, are AMD(TM) and Intel(TM).

This ComputeCpp Package version {version} supports SYCL pass:[C++] libraries
for better integration with pass:[C++] frameworks and applications like
link:{syclParallelStlUrl}[SYCL Parallel STL], math libraries like link:{eigenSYCLUrl}[SYCL Eigen Tensor Library] and machine vision libraries.

The ComputeCpp Package includes the components of the ComputeCpp Community Edition
beta implementation of SYCL 1.2. ComputeCpp Package includes the pass:[compute++] SYCL
device compiler and the SYCL Runtime library along with its headers. The
ComputeCpp Package can be downloaded from the
link:{computecppUrl}[ComputeCpp Download Page], and further details on how to
integrate the ComputeCpp Package to an existing pass:[C++] application can be found
in the link:{computecppIntegrationGuide}[ComputeCpp Integration Guide].

The ComputeCpp SDK complements the ComputeCpp Package with build system
integration, sample code and documentation. The ComputeCpp Package is available at
link:{computecppSdkUrl}[computecpp-sdk @ *GitHub*].

Further documentation of the system can also be found in
link:{computecppUrl}[ComputeCpp API Documentation].
There is a local copy of the API Documentation available in the directory
_doc/api_pages/index.html_ of the ComputeCpp Package.

ComputeCpp CE does not currently implement the complete SYCL 1.2 standard.
Note that this is a beta version, and some performance optimizations are
disabled.

Please, refer to the
link:{platformSupportUrl}[ComputeCpp Platform Support Notes] for details on the
supported platforms and limitations.
