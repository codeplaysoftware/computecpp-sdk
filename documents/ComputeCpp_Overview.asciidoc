==  ComputeCpp(TM) Community Edition (CE): Beta Release

ComputeCpp Community Edition (CE) is a heterogeneous parallel programming
platform that provides a beta pre-conformant implementantion of the SYCL(TM)
1.2 Khronos link:{syclSpecUrl}[specification].

ComputeCpp supports SYCL pass:[C++] libraries for better integration with
pass:[C++] frameworks and applications like the
link:{syclParallelStlUrl}[SYCL Parallel STL], math libraries like
link:{eigenSYCLUrl}[SYCL Eigen Tensor Library] and machine vision libraries.

The ComputeCpp Package includes the components of the ComputeCpp Community Edition
beta implementation of SYCL 1.2. ComputeCpp Package includes the pass:[compute++] SYCL
device compiler and the SYCL Runtime library along with its headers. The
ComputeCpp Package can be downloaded from the
link:{computecppUrl}[ComputeCpp Download Page], and a link:{computecppGettingStarted}[Getting Started guide] is available.

Further details on how to integrate the ComputeCpp Package to an existing pass:[C++] application 
can be found in the link:{computecppIntegrationGuide}[ComputeCpp Integration Guide].

The ComputeCpp SDK complements the ComputeCpp Package with build system
integration, sample code and documentation. The ComputeCpp Package is available at
link:{computecppgithub}[computecpp-sdk @ *GitHub*].

Further documentation of the system can also be found in
link:{computecppUrl}[ComputeCpp API Documentation].
There is a local copy of the API Documentation available in the directory
_doc/api_pages/index.html_ of the ComputeCpp Package.

ComputeCpp CE does not currently implement the complete SYCL 1.2 standard.
Note that this is a beta version, and some performance optimizations are
disabled.

Please, refer to the
link:{platformSupportUrl}[ComputeCpp Platform Support Notes] for details on the
supported platforms and limitations.
