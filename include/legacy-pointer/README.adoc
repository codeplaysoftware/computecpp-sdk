Legacy Pointer Interface Utility
================================

This folder contains a legacy pointer interface utility header, that
facilitates integrating SYCL applications into codebases that rely on
malloc/free allocations on the device.

The utility header offers an interface to simluate the traditional C behaviour
of malloc a pointer on the device and free it later.

The malloc returns a non-dereferenciable pointer that can be used later in
SYCL code to retrieve the buffer it refers to, plus an offset into it.

Usage
-----

Include the _legacy_pointer.hpp_ file in your program, and replace your
device malloc/free operations with *codeplay::legacy::malloc/free*

To retrieve the buffer from the pointer, just use the function
*codeplay::legacy::PointerMapper::get_buffer_id* to obtain the buffer id
from the PointerMapper class, and then the method
*codeplay::legacy::PointerMapper::get_buffer* to obtain the SYCL buffer.

Building tests
--------------

1. mkdir build # in SDK root
2. cd build
3. cmake ../ -DCOMPUTECPP_PACKAGE_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/computecpp/package \
   -DCOMPUTECPP_SDK_BUILD_TESTS=1
4. make legacy-basic legacy-offset
